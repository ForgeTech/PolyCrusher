  hintTitle: THE GREAT FLUSH
  hintText: The Great Flush is a drastic event in space-time which led to the creation
    of beings without past. These beings are known to be extremly hostile towards
    everything with history. As their existence is not bound to causality, they sometimes
    wear hats.
